# path_finder
In this path finder you can choose between different algorithms and watch them solve mazes you create yourself.
Controlls ingame:

mouse click -> wall
w -> water (cost = 3)
r -> reset map and algorithm
c -> change algorithm only
s -> start point
e -> end point
l -> clear drawn path
d -> delete cell
SPACE -> start path finding

Make sure you have tkinter and pygame installed and at least python 3.6
