# path_finder
In this path finder you can choose between different algorithms and watch them solve mazes you create yourself.
`path_finder_game_class.py` is the newer version with OOP.

FUNCTION:
the other 2 files need to be in the same folder for them to work. They are based on functions.


Controlls ingame:

* mouse click -> wall
* w -> water (cost = 3)
* r -> reset map and algorithm
* c -> change algorithm only
* s -> start point
* e -> end point
* l -> clear drawn path
* d -> delete cell
* m -> 100 random walls 
* n -> 50 random water that are not walls
* SPACE -> start path finding

Make sure you have tkinter and pygame installed and at least python 3.6 for list comprehensions.
